# ðŸ‘‹Hi Robbie
This is a file that shows what this project is and it has some extra stuff at the bottom if you become interested in running this instance locally. If you want to see what the last commit looks like live (remember, this is an in-progress project), you can find it here: https://robbie-portfolio.vercel.app/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi other devs
I am a freelance web developer. This project is an aboutMe/portfolio website for a client. This project will be using quite a few dependencies to fulfill client requests. I'll be using Next.js as my framework to handle image optimization, routing, and it should give me a better shot at meeting my stretch goals. I'm traditionally a React developer, but Next seems like it'll do more heavy lifting for me. This is my first Next project. I'll be starting with Tailwind/DaisyUI components just to get code on the page ASAP. Stretch goals for the project include a SendGrid integration for the contact page and a parallax effect using React-Spring. I'll be using unsplash assets as well as photos I am producing for the client. Project completion is set for June 20th, 2023.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
